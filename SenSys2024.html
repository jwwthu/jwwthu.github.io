                    <p align="left">
                        The topic of IoT (Internet of Things) datasets for multi-modal large models are is centered on the integration and utilization of diverse data sources generated by IoT devices for training and enhancing the capabilities of large-scale machine learning models. IoT datasets typically involve a wide range of data types, including but not limited to sensor data, video streams, audio signals, and text logs. These datasets capture various aspects of the physical world, from environmental conditions to human activities, and provide rich contextual information for model training. The key aspect of multi-modal large models is their ability to process and analyze multiple types of data simultaneously. By leveraging IoT datasets, these models can gain a deeper understanding of the world by combining different types of information. For example, a model trained on both sensor data and video streams can detect patterns and correlations between environmental conditions and human behavior, enabling more accurate predictions and decision-making.

                        There are still many challenges and opportunities associated with handling large-scale, distributed, and heterogeneous IoT data. This includes issues such as data collection, preprocessing, storage, and privacy concerns, as well as the development of efficient algorithms and techniques for data integration and analysis. To overcome these challenges, we would like to invite worldwide researcher to share and present their latest research progresses on datasets, methodology and application about IoT datasets for multi-modal large models, including but not limited to the following main topics.
