                        <h2>Summary</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p align="left">
                        In the pursuit of ever-advancing communication capabilities, the convergence of space, air, and ground networks stands at the forefront of innovation. As we transition into the era of 6G technology, the concept of distributed and integrated communication, sensing, and computing in space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN) emerges as a pivotal paradigm shift. At its core, integration of communication, sensing, and computing in SAGIN embodies the fusion of diverse technologies and platforms to create a seamless, interconnected network fabric spanning across the celestial realms, the atmospheric domain, and terrestrial landscapes. This integration transcends traditional boundaries, harnessing the collective strengths of space-borne satellites, aerial vehicles, and ground-based infrastructure.

                        The convergence of these disparate elements into a cohesive SAGIN framework heralds a new era of connectivity, where ubiquitous, high-speed communication, pervasive sensing, and distributed computing capabilities empower a multitude of emerging applications and services. From smart cities and autonomous transportation to immersive virtual environments and beyond, the possibilities enabled by integration of communication, sensing, and computing in SAGIN are as vast as the expanses of the cosmos themselves.

                        There are still many challenges and opportunities associated with distributed and integrated communication, sensing, and computing in space-air-ground integrated networks for 6G. This includes issues such as efficient resource allocation, mobility and handover management, QoS-aware routing and scheduling, energy-efficient communication protocols and scalable network architectures. To overcome these challenges, we would like to invite worldwide researcher to share and present their latest research progresses, including but not limited to the following main topics.
