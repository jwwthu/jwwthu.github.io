                    <p align="left">
                        The Workshop on Federated Learning for Autonomous and Connected Vehicles is a specialized academic–industry forum that brings together researchers, automotive engineers, data scientists, and cybersecurity experts to explore federated learning (FL) as a privacy-preserving, decentralized learning paradigm for next–generation mobility systems. It focuses on bridging FL algorithms, edge computing, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications, and autonomous driving tasks, including environmental perception, trajectory prediction, collaborative mapping, and intelligent decision-making, while addressing critical challenges such as on–device data heterogeneity, limited communication bandwidth, real–time inference latency, and strict automotive data privacy and safety regulations. Through technical talks, panel discussions, and demo presentations, the workshop fosters interdisciplinary collaboration to advance robust, scalable, and secure FL frameworks that enable connected vehicles to collectively learn without sharing raw sensor or user data, accelerating the reliable deployment of autonomous driving while complying with global data governance standards.
