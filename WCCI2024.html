                    <p align="left">
                        Evolutionary computation is a computational paradigm inspired by the principles of biological evolution, and it has found applications in various fields, including wireless communications. Evolutionary algorithms simulate the process of natural selection, reproduction, and mutation to evolve solutions to optimization problems. In the context of wireless communications, evolutionary techniques are employed to optimize and adapt wireless systems to dynamic and complex environments. Wireless communication systems often face optimization challenges, such as resource allocation, power control, and network configuration. Evolutionary computation can optimize the allocation of resources like frequency bands, time slots, and power to maximize network performance and minimize interference. Wireless communication environments are dynamic and subject to changes in user demand, interference, and channel conditions. Evolutionary computation provides adaptive solutions that can continuously evolve and adjust to changing circumstances, making it well-suited for dynamic wireless scenarios. Many wireless communication problems involve multiple conflicting objectives, such as maximizing throughput while minimizing power consumption. Evolutionary computation excels in handling multi-objective optimization, offering a set of solutions representing trade-offs between conflicting goals (Pareto front). Research challenges still exist, including the need for efficient algorithms capable of handling real-time optimization, scalability for large-scale networks, and addressing diverse and evolving wireless communication standards.

                        In this special session, we would like to invite worldwide researcher to share and present their latest research progresses on theory, methodology and application about evolutionary computation in wireless communications, including but not limited to evolutionary algorithms, machine learning and deep learning.
